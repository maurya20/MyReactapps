          Home is a 2015 American computer-animated science-fiction comedy
          film[4][5] produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by 20th
          Century Fox. Loosely based on Adam Rex's 2007 children's book The True
          Meaning of Smekday, the film was directed by Tim Johnson from a
          screenplay by Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember, and stars the voices of Jim
          Parsons, Rihanna, Steve Martin, Jennifer Lopez, and Matt Jones. The
          story takes place on near-future planet Earth, where an alien race
          called the Boov invade the planet. However, a feisty human girl named
          Gratuity Tucci nicknamed Tip manages to avoid capture, and goes on the
          run with Oh, a fugitive Boov and together, the two form an unlikely
          friendship whilst searching for Tip's mother and avoiding capture from
          the Boov. The film was released in theaters on March 27, 2015.[6] Home
          was promoted with the release of a four-minute short film titled
          Almost Home, which was shown in theaters before DreamWorks Animation's
          Mr. Peabody & Sherman and Blue Sky Studios' Rio 2 in 2014. It
          premiered at the Boulder International Film Festival on March 7, 2015.
          Besides lending her voice to the film, Rihanna also created a concept
          album of the same name. The soundtrack also includes guest vocals from
          Jennifer Lopez, among others, and was supported by two singles,
          "Towards the Sun" and "Feel the Light". Home received mixed reviews
          from critics and grossed $386 million worldwide. A Netflix original
          series was released on July 29, 2016 that takes place after the events
          of the film. It uses hand-drawn animation and none of the original
          cast (except Jones) reprised their roles.
